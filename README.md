# UFO's :alien:

## Overview of Project:
- Explain the strengths and weaknesses of JavaScript "standard" and JavaScript version ES6+.
- Describe JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases.
- Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.
- Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions.
- Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop).
- Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML.

### Results:

 - [x]  1st. We created a web page with Javascript with variable criteria, where Dana and any other user's are able to see the following fields:

- Enter a City
- Enter a State
- Enter a Country
- Enter a Shape

	`For a better appreciation and location of the field you can consult it in the following image:`

- [x]  2nd. When a user enters a search criteria the Javascore will enter the values in the text box and ID's associated with the text box and the Javascript object. We can perform the search with a single filter, for example to sear only in the City "El Cajon" as the following image:

- [x] 3rd. As we can see, we have several searches with the search of "El Cajon", if we want a more detailed search we can use multiple search criterias.

### Summary: :face_with_spiral_eyes:

One drawback is that the sight only includes sightings from the US. One recommendation is to expand the data, I'm sure it'll have a better audience and more visits expanding the search around the world. Another point of improvement for the platform is that it would be godlike that the public could add videos or photos where they have managed to have contact with extraterrestrials, with prior authorization from an administrator of the page to validate that the videos are authentic. Â¡The visual will always be attractive!
